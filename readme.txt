This plugin adds lightweight customizations to your WordPress login screen to make it look neat and professional.

== Description ==
There's now a really easy way to customize your login page without having to worry about slowing things down — we're talking under 20KB.

This simple plugin allows you to *Whitelabel* your WordPress Login screen or in other words replace the default WP logo with your site name/logo. As such, this plugin is **not meant to beautify** your login screen, but rather to help you rebrand it in a few seconds.

There's also a few extra settings in case you just feel like. Just head over to the settings section of your WordPress admin dashboard and click Super Light Login (**Settings > Super Light Login**) to get started.

Note that you will not see any changes until you save the settings you are comfortable with, if you're comfortable with the default settings just click *save* without making any changes.

Currently this plugin provides the following options:

**Register Text and Link Settings**

* Change *Register Text*
* Change *Register Link*

**Logo Replacement Settings**

* Enable/Disable logo replacement
* Change replacement text link

== Installation ==
Just activate the plugin and visit your login page to see the plugin at work. Visit `Settings > Super Light Login` and click *Save* if you do not see any change after activating the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I undo changes made with the plugin? =
